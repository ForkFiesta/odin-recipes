        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a bowl; pour 1/2 of the lemon juice over chicken and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Place chicken into hot oil. Add remaining lemon juice and oregano; season with black pepper. Cook chicken until golden brown and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
